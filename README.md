🔍 **Understanding the Full Subtractor in Digital Logic**

A **Full Subtractor** is a fundamental combinational circuit used in digital systems to perform binary subtraction. Unlike a half subtractor, it accounts for borrow from the previous stage, making it essential for multi-bit binary operations.

🧠 **Key Features:**
- **Inputs:**  
  - A (Minuend)  
  - B (Subtrahend)  
  - Bin (Borrow-in)  
- **Outputs:**  
  - D (Difference)  
  - Bout (Borrow-out)

📐 **Logic Expressions:**  
- **Difference (D):**  
  \( D = A \oplus B \oplus Bin \)  
- **Borrow-out (Bout):**  
  \( Bout = A'B + A'Bin + BBin \)

🧩 **Applications:**  
- Used in Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)  
- Crucial for designing subtractor circuits in processors  
- Enables accurate multi-bit subtraction with borrow handling

💡 Whether you're diving into digital design or brushing up on combinational circuits, the full subtractor is a great example of elegant logic engineering.
